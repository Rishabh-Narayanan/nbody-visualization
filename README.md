# nbody-visualization
Java swing visualization of the n-body problem simulation

## Run the project
To run the project, compile the directory using javac:
```bash
javac *.java
```
You can then run the project by running either the NBodyTester.class or the NBodyTester2.class
```bash
java NBodyTester
```
or
```bash
java NBodyTester2
```

## Inspiration
This NBody Visualization was my first coding project that I wrote and it represents the path of different planets in our solar system while taking into account their gravitational pull on each other.

## Usage
Anyone can use this program or parts of it if they need it. You can fork the entire repo if needed. However, I ask that you do not republish this code without giving me some credit (not licensed though - so totally optional).
